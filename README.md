# SimpleNFCReaderWriter

This app works only with NFC reader.
I used another gitgub repository to get ufCoder library.

With this app you can simply read, write or delete some information from NFC card or tag.

This app can be used for many things:
- Start/End of work time
- User identification at shops
- Bank card apps, etc.

With NFC cards you can make simple solution for many applicabilities. Everything you need is to applicate this code to your app.
